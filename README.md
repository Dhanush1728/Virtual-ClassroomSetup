## 📘 Project Overview
The **Virtual Classroom Setup** simulates a basic 3D classroom where students can interact with a tutor through a chat-based question system.  
The user types a question in the chat panel, and the tutor responds instantly using predefined logic.

This project demonstrates:
- Unity UI design  
- 3D modeling using built-in objects  
- Basic AI-style question answering  
- Scene switching using buttons  
- Avatar placement and environment design

## 💬 Chat System Script

### `QAHandler.cs` (Used in Chat Panel)

'''csharp

using UnityEngine;
using TMPro;

public class QAHandler : MonoBehaviour {

    public TMP_InputField inputField;
    public TextMeshProUGUI chatHistory;
    public void OnAsk() {
        string question = inputField.text;
        if (!string.IsNullOrEmpty(question)) {
        
            string answer = GetAnswer(question);
            chatHistory.text += "\nYou: " + question + "\nTutor: " + answer;
            inputField.text = "";
        }
    }
    
    string GetAnswer(string q) {
        if (q.ToLower().Contains("hello")) return "Hello, welcome to the class!";
        if (q.ToLower().Contains("ai")) return "AI stands for Artificial Intelligence.";
        return "Sorry, I don’t know that yet.";
    }
}





**Script Handles:**
